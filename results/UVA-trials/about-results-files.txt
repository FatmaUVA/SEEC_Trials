Aboyt the results files:

- A1 and A2 indicates the testing stations
- pilot (original file named uva-1) has the pilot study results of 16 participants
- w1 has the first week testing (before we decided to do Web360 and a same video test)
- w2 has the 2nd and 3rd weeks testing results (changed to a same video, and Web360)

** Note in A2 web360: the first 7 runs has 0.01 instead of 0.5 because the Insta script crashes and I quickly changed it to use Wev360 and didn't pay attention to the loss rate.
